Variables added

To begin working you should:
    
    1) create file with you code, for example
        (//test_1.txt
          a = ?;
          print a;)
    2) run the program
    3) write the path to this file, for exemple
        (tests\test_1.txt)
        NOTE: path must not exceed 100 characters!
    4) if your code is correct, then you will be asked
       to input the values of variables with "?" operation
    5) each "print" operation will give the result of 
       appropriate expression with its calculating way

Code requirements:

    1) all variables must be initialized before using them
       in expressions
    2) after each expression or "?" there must be a ";"
    3) "?" means that this variable will be set by user
       "print" means that appropriate expression will be
       displayed on screen
    4) variables must not be called "print" or "?"

Good luck!
